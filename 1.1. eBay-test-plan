Objectives
- Verify that eBay core features (buying, selling, bidding) function as expected.
- Validate integrations (payments, notifications).
- Ensure usability, accessibility, and security standards are met.
- Identify defects through manual and automated testing.

Scope of Testing
1. Functional Testing
- User authentication (sign up, login, password recovery).
- Search, filters, and product browsing.
- Product listing creation & management.
- Bidding & "Buy It Now" workflows.
- Checkout (payment, shipping, tax calculation).
- Order tracking, cancellations, refunds.
- Seller dashboard & communication tools.
2. Non-Functional Testing
- Usability & accessibility.
- Performance (e.g. page load times).
3. Regression & Integration Testing
- Notifications (email, push).
- Cross-browser compatibility.
4. Exploratory Testing
- Randomized buyer/seller user journeys.
5. Out of Scope
- Backend database
- Internal admin dashboards
- Non-public beta features

Test Approach
- Manual Testing – Functional flows, exploratory sessions, usability.
- Automated Testing – 10 automated cases covering login, search, cart, checkout, and bidding
- Exploratory Testing – Ad-hoc scenarios (invalid bids).

Test Environment
- Browsers: Chrome, Safari.
- Devices: Desktop, iOS.

Test Deliverables
- Test plan (this document).
- Test cases (manual + automated).
- Bug reports.
- Test summary report.

Risks:
- Payment Failures – failed payments.
- Bida – timing mismatches
- Order Tracking Inaccuracies – Incorrect status updates in shipping information.
- High Traffic / Performance Bottlenecks – Slow page load or system crashes during peak usage.
- Security Vulnerabilities – Weak password enforcement, session management issues, or exposure of sensitive data.
