### ⚠Bug Report 003 (Improper Use of `tabindex="7"`)

| **Field**         | **Details**                                                                                                                                  |

| **Title**         | Improper use of `tabindex="7"` breaks expected keyboard navigation order                                                                    |
| **Description**   | A DOM element uses `tabindex="7"`, which causes the tab order to skip elements and disrupts natural, sequential keyboard navigation, harming accessibility. |
| **Steps**         | 1. Navigate to an eBay Live page.<br>2. Use `Tab` to navigate through focusable elements.<br>3. Observe that a certain element jumps to an unexpected position in the tab order. |
| **Expected Result** | All focusable elements should follow a logical and sequential `tabindex` order (`0` or `-1` preferred). Manually assigning positive values should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. |
| **Actual Result**   | An element uses `tabindex="7"`, creating a non-standard focus order. This breaks the accessibility flow and may confuse users relying on keyboard navigation. |
| **Failing Element** | `<a class="gh-search-button__advanced-link" href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/ebayadvsearch" _sp="m570.l2614" tabindex="7">Advanced</a> `|
| **Suggested Fix** | Remove the hardcoded positive `tabindex` value. <br /> Avoid all positive `tabindex` values to ensure consistent, predictable navigation. <br /> Identify the selected content area and give it a tabindex of -1 and call its focus method. This ensures the content doesn't appear in the natural tab order. This technique, called managing focus, keeps the user's perceived context in sync with the site's visual content. |

### Bug Report 004 (Duplicate Text Content in `alt` and `<span>`)

| **Field**         | **Details**                                                                                                                                          |

| **Title**         | Redundant content in `alt` attribute and visible `<span>` causes duplicate announcements by screen readers                                          |
| **Description**   | The image `alt` attribute (`alt="vandythepink"`) repeats the same text as the adjacent `<span>` element, which is also visually and semantically available. This causes screen readers to announce the same label twice, reducing usability for visually impaired users. |
| **Steps**         | 1. Navigate to a seller profile link on eBay Live (e.g. `/ebaylive/sellers/`).<br>2. Use a screen reader to read the content.<br>3. Observe that "vandythepink" is read twice due to both `alt` and `<span>` being announced. |
| **Expected Result** | Text should not be duplicated between image `alt` text and adjacent readable content. If the image is purely decorative or its meaning is conveyed elsewhere, the `alt` should be empty (`alt=""`). |
| **Actual Result**   | Both the image and the `<span>` announce “vandythepink”, leading to redundant output from assistive technologies. |
| **Failing Element** | ```html<br><a class="_host_14obs_112" href="/ebaylive/sellers/p71mvza2rcu" aria-label="Seller vandythepink"><img src=".../$_7.PNG" alt="vandythepink"><span>vandythepink</span></a>``` |
| **Suggested Fix** | - If the image is decorative, set `alt=""`.<br>- If the image is informative, hide the adjacent text from screen readers with `aria-hidden="true"`.|
